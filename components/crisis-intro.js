                Property is one of the core deep codes of our everyday life: often invisible, overlooked or seen as a near-natural law.

                <p className='normal mb-2'>
                But now, crises are bringing property to the fore. Faced with an unprecedented complexity and entanglement of systemic risks, externalities, and value creation in todayâ€™s world, property as a means of governance is increasingly falling short.

                <p className='normal mb-2'>
                To help us prepare for looming crises, we need to delve deeper into the multifaceted challenges of property and build shared understanding and urgency. 
                </p>
                <p className='normal mb-2'>
                We need to rethink property and its role in system responsiveness and resilience, and its potential to drive wider transformational change.

                It serves as a sensemaking tool to anticipate and respond to crises at a system level and identify potential solutions, lead environments, and coalitions to build real-world demonstrations of property futures.
