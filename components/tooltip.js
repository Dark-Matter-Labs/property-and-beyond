                            Unlike traditional risk assessments that focus on classifying the
                            likelihood of risks and the severity of impacts, this tool highlights
                            the inadequacies of existing property and ownership frameworks in
                            addressing and mitigating future risks and the potential for these
                            systemic failures to open up windows of opportunity for alternative
                            solutions.

                            <span className='font-bold'>Definition of Property:</span> The
                            definition of &apos;property&apos; here extends beyond real assets
                            (land, real estate and infrastructure) to encompass other classes of
                            property, including, amongst others, intellectual property, corporate
                            shares, contractual obligations and leases, money and data. We also
                            consider the worldviews underpinning dominant property institutions.

                            <span className='font-bold'>Risk Identification:</span> We identified
                            strategic risks across five domains: AI and innovation, climate,
                            conflict and displacement, labor and economic security, and housing and
                            civic infrastructure. Through a review of literature in each domain,
                            including the national and global risk registers, we shortlisted 20
                            risks that were not only critical in terms of impact, but also
                            representative of the deep rooted problems of property.
                          </p>

                            <span className='font-bold'>Property Linkages:</span> Each risk was
                            analyzed based on its connection to property and ownership as a means of
                            governance. Rather than assessing connections to geographic and
                            context-specific property institutions, our analysis focused on core
                            modalities of the axiomatic concept of property, i.e. the abstract
                            characteristics that define its operability. This abstract analysis
                            allows us to identify where in the code of property we can best innovate
                            to address systemic failures.

                            <span className='font-bold'>Impacts: </span> We mapped for each risk the
                            range of potential impacts of the risk materializing, considering both
                            direct and indirect impacts. This allows us to not only identify areas
                            of key concern, but also to demonstrate relationships between different
                            risks and the potential for compounding crises.

                            <span className='font-bold'>Case Studies:</span> Each strategic risk is
                            supported by relevant case studies. This serves to i) provide concrete
                            examples of how theoretical risks have manifested in real-world
                            situations ii) reveal gaps in current risk analysis and preparedness and
                            iii) showcase how risks and their impacts, as well as their response
                            spaces, vary across geographies and contexts.

                            <span className='font-bold'>Stakeholders:</span> In relation to each
                            risk, we identified individuals, groups, or entities most impacted by or
                            influential in managing the risk. This allows us to identify key
                            stakeholders to engage in solutions spaces and their potential role as
                            lead actor, supporter, or barrier.

                            <span className='font-bold'>Preparedness:</span> We assessed the nature

                            limitations to respond to a specific risk. Wherever existing solutions
                            appear insufficient to address a risk, a window of opportunity could
                            open to shift the Overton window and propose more transformative
                            solutions. Our mapping aims to start building capacity to anticipate
                            where and when such new opportunity spaces might open to help
                            preemptively and strategically build solutions for when they do.

                            continuously develop and iterate the tool by adding new risks and
                            sections, with the aim of providing a more comprehensive overview of
                            global risks through the lens of property. In the second phase, a new
                            section on Proofs of Possibility and Adjacent Possibles will be added â€”
                            describing the critical opportunities and alternative response spaces
                            that emerge through innovating property codes. We welcome comments and
